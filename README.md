## Our goal
Our website is made for a picture gallery. Here you can find different kinds of paintings by different artists, both famous and not so famous. The aim of the gallery is to bring different kinds of pictorial art into the lives of our customers. As the concept is 4 elements, paintings are presented in four colors of elements.

## What problems does our app solve?
Art originates from distant times. With the help of peoples, real masterpieces were created. But unfortunately, many arts disappear, and peoples forget the history, the authors of many beautiful works. The way to solve this problem is the interest of young people in folk art. Therefore, we decided to create a modern and beautiful site that will definitely interest not only young people, but also children and adults!
